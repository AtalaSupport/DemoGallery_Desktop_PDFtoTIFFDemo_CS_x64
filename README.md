# PDFtoTIFFDemo
A very simple console app that converts a PDF file into a TIFF by using in a memory-efficient way using PdfImageSOurce (part of our PdfReader addon.

Who says you always need a viewer in an imaging application?

This console app uses our PdfRasterizer to convert a PDF to a TIFF.

This approach can easily be adapted to services or plumbed in to batch-based processing.

By setting a handler for TiffEncoder.SetEncoderCompression, we are able to dynamically select the most appropriate form of image compression to apply, based on the PixelFormat (color depth) of each page

This is the C# version. We also have a [VB.NET version](https://github.com/AtalaSupport/DemoGallery_Desktop_PDFtoTIFFDemo_VB_x64) available.


## Instructions
After installing and activating the SDK, you can unzip, build and run this solution. It will prompt you for a PDF File with an OpenFileDialog.

Select the PDF you want to convert and open. It will then prompt you where to save the TIFF and for filename. The file will be converted and saved.


## Licensing
This application requires a license for DotImage Document Imaging as well as our PdfReader addon. You may also request a 30 day evaulation if youre evaluating if DotImage is right for you.


## SDK Dependencies
This app was built based on 2026.2.0.0. It targets .NET Framework 4.6.2 and was created in Visual Studio 2022. You must have our SDK installed (and licesed per above)

### Using NuGet for SDK Dependencies
We do publish our SDK components to NuGet. We have chosen to base the demo on local installed SDK because this leads to much smaller applications (NuGet packages add a lot of overhead due to the way they're packaged and deployed, and many of our demos -- including this one -- are often used to reproduce issues that need to be submitted to support. Apps that use NuGet are often significantly larger and run up against our maximum support case upload size)

Still, if you wish to use NuGet for the dependencies instead of relying on locally installed SDK, you can.
